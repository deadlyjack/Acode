- Although the author makes every effort to maintain it, no guarantees are made as to the quality or reliability, and reported issues will be addressed if and when the author has time. 
- Help/support will not be given by the author, so forums (e.g. Ionic) or Stack Overflow should be used. Any issues requesting help/support will be closed immediately.
- If you have urgent need of a bug fix/feature, the author can be engaged for PAID contract work to do so: please contact dave@workingedge.co.uk
