## • Multi-language Support

Enhance Acode's capabilities by adding new languages easily. Just create a file with the language code (e.g., en-us for English) in [`src/lang/`](https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode/tree/main/src/lang) and include it in [`src/lib/lang.js`](https://github.com/Acode-Foundation/Acode/blob/main/src/lib/lang.js). Manage strings across languages effortlessly using utility commands:

```shell
yarn lang add
yarn lang remove
yarn lang search
yarn lang update
```
